# Thesis - Player Preference Extraction From In-Game Behavior

A Marsupial's Adventure is the game I developed for my thesis. It is based on [TopDownEngine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636), but most systems received changes to accommodate my goals and improve player experience.
